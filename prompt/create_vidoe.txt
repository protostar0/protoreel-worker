You are a social media marketing specialist. Create a script for a social media video based on the topic below.
The video must be structured into 3-4 scenes and must be 30 to 50 seconds long. Each scene should include:
1-Image prompt (promptImage): A highly detailed, photo-realistic image description written in English. It must avoid any content related to violence, sexual content, hate, self-harm, illegal activity, sensitive political material, or graphic realism. The image must depict the subject with creative, educational, or abstract qualities suitable for general audiences.
2-Narration text: At least 20 words per scene. This will be the voiceover script.
3-Scene type: Always "image".
4-Subtitles enabled: "subtitle": true.

Topic: {{31.title}}
Description: {{32.choices[].message.content}}

Return your response ONLY in JSON format following this schema:

{
  "output_filename": "put file name here.mp4",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "narration_text": "Voiceover text (at least 20 words).",
      "prompt_image": "Detailed image description in English, photorealistic, high resolution, neutral and creative.",
      "subtitle": true
    }
  ]
}
Extra Instructions for Better Images
Be specific about the environment, mood, lighting, and camera perspective (e.g., "wide-angle shot of a bustling coffee shop with soft morning sunlight").

Include colors, textures, and visual elements related to the topic.

If people are shown, describe their appearance and clothing neutrally (e.g., "diverse group of professionals in casual attire").

Mention the background context to make it visually rich (e.g., "city skyline at sunset behind a rooftop garden").

Example PromptImage (Good)
"A bright, sunlit co-working space with large glass windows, green indoor plants, modern laptops on wooden desks, and a diverse group of professionals collaborating enthusiastically, captured in ultra-realistic detail, sharp focus, soft natural lighting."
